# Developer's Guides

This is a simple and generic guide for developers to follow some best practices and also can be used as day to day activities check list for developers


## Git

- [ ] Use clear commit that follows our templates and standards
- [ ] Commit message format must be:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>

subject: subject contains succinct description of the change
scope: The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change
body: body should include the motivation, use present tense

```

- [ ] Leaeve good trail of history which makes sense, just like you are reading a story about software evolution
- [ ] Never push before you check if your commit is ACID
- [ ] Never alter a public history
- [ ] If you are happy then push your changes


### Code review & validation

- [ ] Code must explain the intend & purpose no comments please !
- [ ] Don't use HACKS use language best practices / framework best practices
- [ ] Use VSCODE to review & validate your changes
- [ ] Use GOOGLE CHROME DEV TOOL to see if you are not breaking anything.


## Release

- [ ] Be aware of the status of the sprint and realistic time required to complete the release
- [ ] Never edit content on Deployment
- [ ] UAT is the true test enviroment
- [ ] Authoring is a part of the live enviroment
- [ ] The release is completed only when Docs and Release note and Test Scripts must be in valid state
- [ ] See docs for more information

### Task completion

- [ ] Prefer easy & simple solution over complex solution
- [ ] DON'T
  - [ ] use console.log for obvious things .e.g. testing ektron
  - [ ] put break point as it is valid for specific case
- [ ] Fix your chrome dev tool so you can see the call-stack properly


### Test strategy

- [ ] Scan the page and don't do inspect element or don't see code
- [ ] While testing you don't have to do the fixing
- [ ] Time-Box your fixes time it is very important
- [ ] Stay active in SLACK it is the most important things


## Agile

- [ ] Daily scrum must be short simple and uses the team language, it should contains: Status, Day Objective and any type of Blocker
- [ ] Working on stories mean respect the feature requirments and user interaction but not to add or remove/alter any requirments


### Important advices & guidelines to follow
